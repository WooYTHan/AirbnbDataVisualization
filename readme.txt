GoalMore and more people tend to use Airbnb to save budget, make friends and, most importantly, experience a city like a local. In the meantime, more rooms are cleaned, decorated and leased for small fortunes or just fun. We hope with our thorough study of Airbnb data and resulting visualization, people could use Airbnb more efficiently, maximizing their benefit both as travelers and landlords.Choice of DatasetThe dataset we use is from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The website provides data publicly available from Airbnb. The reason we choose this dataset is that it contains well-organized comprehensive data ready to be used directly in data analysis. Our main goal is to discover patterns behind the distribution of various room types/prices across the US. Our main stakeholders will be both hosts and guests.
